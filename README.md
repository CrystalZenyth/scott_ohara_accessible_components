# Accessible Components  
I've built a good handful of accessible markup patterns and widgets at this point. Each is based on testing with users, UX and design needs of past projects, and from following W3C specifications & notes. I do enjoy making these :)  

These components all live in their own repositories. There are a few components that are just static markup patterns, and any additional functionality would need to be supplied by you.  


## Vanilla JavaScripts
The following scripts create custom UI components and widgets that require the use of ARIA:  
* [Accordions (v3)](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_accordions)

## More may come...
I'll update these patterns as I see fit.  

If you end up using any of these components, [please let me know](https://twitter.com/scottohara)!  

Most importantly, if you ever come across a bug or awkward UX quirk with a component listed here, please file an issue in the that component's GitHub repository.  

Thanks!
